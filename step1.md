Next Steps
Based on this analysis, here are my recommendations for the next steps, in order of priority:
Implement Backend for Fiat Transactions: Connect the fiat DepositForm and WithdrawForm to a backend service. This seems like a smaller task than implementing the full trading interface and is crucial for wallet functionality.
Implement the Order Book: Create a new component for the order book. This will be a key part of your trading interface.
Create a Full Trading Page: Design and build a dedicated page for trading a specific pair. This page would bring together the QuickTrade form (or a more advanced version of it), the new order book component, a price chart, and the user's order history.
Connect Trading Components to Backend: Wire up the QuickTrade form and the order history table to your tradeService.
You've built a very solid foundation. The component structure is good, the UI is clean, and you are using modern React practices. The main remaining work is to implement the missing pieces and connect the frontend components to your backend services.
